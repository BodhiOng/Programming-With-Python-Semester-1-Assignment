# Tuition center management system

This program is meant to emulate a management system that stores information from admin, receptionist, tutor, and a student. For further clarity on functionalities and what this program does please read [PYP Assignment Briefing From Lecturer](https://github.com/BodhiOng/Programming-With-Python-Semester-1-Assignment/blob/main/Assignment%20Briefing%20%26%20Report/PYP%20Assignment%20Briefing%20From%20Lecturer.pdf) and [PYP Report](https://github.com/BodhiOng/Programming-With-Python-Semester-1-Assignment/blob/main/Assignment%20Briefing%20%26%20Report/PYP%20Report.docx). 

## How to run the program
Run `login.py` and log in with the username & password in `main_database.txt`. Note that each one of the .py roles is connected to certain .txt files in which the direct relation could be seen by reading the functions in the script or assessing the comments typed. Thus, if further inputs are required from the role before executing the functionality, please fill the inputs with information that is available on the .txt files unless the prompt demands an input that is different from the original information, just follow the given instructions accordingly.
